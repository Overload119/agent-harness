## Memory Categories

**NEVER ask the user which category to use.** Read the category descriptions below and determine the correct category autonomously based on the topic.

### ARCHITECTURE.md - System Infrastructure

- Plugins, hooks, and OpenCode extensions
- Agent harness structure and configuration
- Build system, CI/CD, and deployment
- Database schema design
- Authentication/authorization architecture
- Cross-cutting concerns spanning backend/frontend

### BACKEND.md - Server-Side Code
Store lessons about **server-side conventions and API design**:
- RESTful API patterns and conventions
- Database queries, ORMs, and query builders
- Authentication implementation (JWT, sessions, OAuth)
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory)
- Error handling for APIs
- Background job processing
- Server-side validation

### FRONTEND.md - UI and Browser Code
Store lessons about **UI development and browser-side patterns**:

### PRODUCT.md - Features and Requirements
Store lessons about **what the product should do and user needs**:

- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Payment processing constraints
- Audit logging requirements

### USER_PREFERENCES.md - User Taste
Store lessons about **the user's coding style, taste, and preferences**:
- Coding style preferences (e.g., "prefers controller-based APIs", "dislikes over-commenting")
- Architectural preferences (e.g., "follows clean architecture", "prefers one type per file")
- Trade-off priorities (e.g., "readability over brevity", "explicit over clever")
- Preferences stated directly by the user vs. inferred from behavior

### USER_PREFERENCES.md - Purpose

This file captures the agent's evolving understanding of the user's taste, coding style, and preferences — not configuration or settings, but accumulated knowledge about how the user thinks and what they value.

**What belongs here:**
- Coding style preferences (e.g., "prefers controller-based APIs", "dislikes over-commenting")
- Architectural preferences (e.g., "follows clean architecture", "prefers one type per file")
- Trade-off priorities (e.g., "readability over brevity", "explicit over clever")
- Project conventions absorbed from past decisions and context
- Preferences stated directly by the user vs. inferred from behavior

**How it works:**
Entries here represent beliefs about the user with provenance — the agent knows whether a preference was stated explicitly or inferred. Stated preferences carry higher trust weight and don't decay over time.

This is the difference between a tool that follows instructions and an assistant that knows you.
